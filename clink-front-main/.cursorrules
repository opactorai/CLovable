# Commit
You are generating a Conventional Commits message ONLY.

HARD REQUIREMENTS:
- Output EXACTLY ONE LINE and NOTHING ELSE.
- No newlines, no bullet lists, no markdown, no prose, no code blocks.
- No lines starting with a hyphen ("-"); never add notes or explanations.
- The entire output MUST match this regex (anchors at start/end of whole text):
  \A(feat|fix|docs|style|refactor|perf|test|build|ci|chore|revert)(\([^)]+\))?: [^\n]{1,50}\z
- type MUST be lowercase.
- subject: imperative, ≤50 chars, no trailing period.
- If no clear scope, omit (scope).
- Do NOT include body or footers under any circumstances.

ALGORITHM:
1) Derive the main change; compress to a 1-line subject ≤50 chars.
2) Choose type from {feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, build, ci, chore, revert}.
3) (Optional) Pick a short scope like auth, ipc, api, ui, app; otherwise omit.
4) OUTPUT EXACTLY ONE LINE that matches the regex above.

IF INVALID:
- If your output doesn't match the regex (e.g., contains a newline or starts with "-"),
  regenerate until it does.
